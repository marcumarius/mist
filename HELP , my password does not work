Hello ethereum team , I'm Dani and i'm in a bit of a situation PLEASE help me 

50 days ago I've donwloaded ethereum wallet into my computer without letting the wallet to SYNC and download all BLOCKCHAINS because it took about 4-5days and its still not synched , anyways i've bought 8 ETH and scanned my  wallet and it's there. 

Currently i recceived a computer which is way better than my own and finally installed the ethereum wallet again and synched the wallet at last so i can see my 8ETH without scanning online.

The problem is when i installed the ethereum wallet 50days back the app requested me a PASSWORD wich i didnt know it will be linked to my main account ( i thought it was a password for the ethereum app )

So now in the present day , i have my wallet with all the ether in it but i can not move it to bittrex platform without the password , 

The interesting thing is I have written down the passsword but does not match and i think i a problem of a LOWER UPPER case letter 

I only have on a USB the KEYSTORE FILE (UTC-xxxxxxxxxxxx) , but i still have the ethereum wallet on the laptop if there is any file i might need from it)

IS there any chance that the Password i put in my laptop without synching , did not reach the system , so there fore i have no password ??

What can i do ? Please HELP ME
